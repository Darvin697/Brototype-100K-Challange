veriable
data type------int  - %d
               float - %f
               char - %c

declaration ----> declrian the veriable after int main inside the brace eq.int a,
initialization ----> assiging the value for the veriable by ourseloves like eq. a=10



there are something called an escape character "&d"


operators  - different type of operators


+,-,*,/   ---- mathematical operators

==,<,>,<=,>= ----- relational operators

&&,||,! ---- logical operators

=,+=,-= --- assignment operators

== -- equalto
= -- assign to 



control statements
if(condition){     -----> when it become true then the command inside the brace starts 

}
else
if you have to write the false case then we use else also

checking for checking the condition 

nestedif ---->if we have to check three  condition we used 


switch -- switch is used as like elseif ladder 
           switch checks every cases and comes directly to the case where we write the condition.



1. Arithmetic Operators
These are used for mathematical calculations:

+ (Addition)
- (Subtraction)
* (Multiplication)
/ (Division)
% (Modulus)
2. Relational Operators
These compare two values and return a boolean result (true or false):

== (Equal to)
!= (Not equal to)
> (Greater than)
< (Less than)
>= (Greater than or equal to)
<= (Less than or equal to)
3. Logical Operators
These combine multiple conditions:

&& (Logical AND)
|| (Logical OR)
! (Logical NOT)
4. Bitwise Operators
These perform operations on bits:

& (Bitwise AND)
| (Bitwise OR)
^ (Bitwise XOR)
~ (Bitwise NOT)
<< (Left shift)
>> (Right shift)
5. Assignment Operators
These assign values to variables:

= (Simple assignment)
+= (Add and assign)
-= (Subtract and assign)
*= (Multiply and assign)
/= (Divide and assign)
%= (Modulus and assign)
&= (Bitwise AND and assign)
|= (Bitwise OR and assign)
^= (Bitwise XOR and assign)
<<= (Left shift and assign)
>>= (Right shift and assign)
6. Increment and Decrement Operators
These increase or decrease the value by one:

++ (Increment)
-- (Decrement)
7. Conditional (Ternary) Operator
This is a shorthand for an if-else statement:

? : (Syntax: condition ? expression1 : expression2)
8. Comma Operator
Used to separate multiple expressions:

, (Comma)
9. Sizeof Operator
Returns the size of a data type or variable:

sizeof
10. Pointer Operators
These are used with pointers:

* (Dereference operator)
& (Address-of operator)
11. Member Selection Operators
These are used to access members of structures and unions:

. (Direct member access)
-> (Indirect member access through a pointer)
12. Type Casting Operator
Used to convert one data type to another:

(type) (e.g., (int), (float))



switch statement -----> here we can put a constant as like 1,2,3
                        then its maches with the case number
